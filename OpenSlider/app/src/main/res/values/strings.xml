    <!--About Open Slider Screen-->
    <string name="about_TV1">Thank you for installing Open Slider.</string>
    <string name="about_TV2">Open Slider is a project created by Greg Deeth to make it easy to build and control a camera slider from your PC or Android device while remaining open source so that anyone can customize the way it works for their own needs.  A basic motorized slider can be built for under $200 and does not need any special tools or advanced knowledge.  If you have a DIY 3D printer, you will be familiar with the required parts.</string>
    <string name="about_TV3">Being a lone developer on the side, support is nearly non existent.  Please take advantage of the forum located in the menu to ask questions and post comments.</string>
